For the transmitter, we implemented a 16-QAM modulation scheme, to transmit an image over a USRP channel, receive the same image and compare BER. The transmitted signal, xbase(t), is padded with a preamble comprising 1600 frequency synchronization bits, 200 pseudorandom timing synchronization bits, 200 pseudorandom frame synchronization bits, and 200 pseudorandom pilot sequence bits. To ensure a BER of less than 1 percent for the message of 20520 information bits, we split the message into 20 segments. The final signal consists of the preamble followed by 20 segments of data with a pilot signal before each one aside from the data segment directly after the preamble. The pilot sequences were used to update the equalizer to be optimal for each frame. Once the message is assembled in the form of bits, the signal is translated into 16-QAM, and QAM symbols are upsampled and then convolved with the SRRCR pulse. To keep the signal within the required bandwidth, an alpha value of 0.3 was used and the filter length was set to 30 samples per symbol for 12 symbols. The signal is then transmitted through a USRP radio server, and we receive a receivedsignal.mat file from the remote server. Our transmitted signal has a symbol rate of 16.7M symbols/s. 

At the receiver, this signal, ybase(t), is convolved with the matched filter, followed by timing synchronization and frame synchronization processes. The timing sync finds where the preamble starts while the frame sync process finds the beginning of each pilot sequence before the 20 data frames. Once the beginning of the preamble and each frame is known, sampling is done to change down from 200M samples per second. The sampled signal is then run through an MMSE-LE equalizer. This is a change from the mid-project review since we used a one-tap equalizer before. The MMSE-LE (with the LMS algorithm) uses a 6-tap setup and a mu value of 0.2. These values yielded the best results in terms of the lowest BER. The MMSE didnâ€™t perform well enough to compensate for the phase offset that worsened for each frame. This problem may have resulted from insufficient training at the beginning of the preamble before starting to equalize data bits. To add additional phase compensation, we offset the phase for frames by the average phase offset of the pilot signals before and after the data. This significantly and reliably lowered BER to under 1 percent during all our testing. The receiver then guesses constellation points from the samples and converts from 16-QAM back to bits. The final step is to simply check against the reference image for calculating BER.
